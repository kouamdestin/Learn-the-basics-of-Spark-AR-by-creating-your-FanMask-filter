## Introduction and Getting Started with Spark AR Studio
**Augmented Reality (AR)** is a technology that allows the superimposition of virtual elements (sounds, 2D, 3D images, videos, etc.) within a real-time environment. The principle is to combine the virtual and the real and give the illusion of perfect integration to the user.

**AR filters** are computer-generated effects designed to be overlaid on real images. AR filters work with your camera, adding a layer or images to the foreground or background of your image. While Instagram AR Filters were first introduced in 2017, it was not possible for anyone to create their own AR filters until recently or Facebook released their AR filter maker app called Spark AR Studio.

**Spark AR Studio** is free software developed by Facebook to help anyone have an augmented reality experience by making AR filters for **Instagram** and **Facebook** for free. AR stands for Augmented Reality. The download site and software (available for Windows and Mac) are in English at the moment, but don't worry, we're here to help. In order to test your AR filters, we recommend that you also download **Spark AR Player**.

**Spark AR Player** is an app for iOS and Android, which lets you see what your AR filters will look like live on a smartphone before posting it publicly on **Instagram** or **Facebook**.

#### Creating your very first Instagram AR filter will mean learning new terminology, here is a step by step guide for you to get started and terminologies used on Spark AR Studio so you can start creating your own filter.

1. **Download the Spark AR Studio software** by going to the official website at the following address: https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/download/. Click on "**download**" at the top right of the page that will appear on your screen
